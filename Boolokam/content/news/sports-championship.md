# India Wins Cricket World Cup in Dramatic Final

In a nail-biting finish that will be remembered for generations, India clinched the Cricket World Cup after a gap of 12 years, defeating Australia by just three runs in the final over.

## The Final Showdown

The match, played at a packed Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, saw India posting a competitive total of 289/8 in their allotted 50 overs. Virat Kohli led the batting with a magnificent century (112 off 110 balls), supported by crucial contributions from Rohit Sharma (45) and Hardik Pandya (38).

Australia's chase started strongly, with David Warner and Mitchell Marsh putting on 73 for the first wicket. However, India's spinners turned the tide in the middle overs, with Kuldeep Yadav taking 3 wickets for just 42 runs.

## The Dramatic Finale

With 13 runs needed off the final over and two wickets in hand, Jasprit Bumrah was handed the ball. In a display of exceptional death bowling, Bumrah conceded just 9 runs while claiming the final Australian wicket with the last ball of the match.

> "This is for every Indian who has supported us through thick and thin. The team showed tremendous character today, and I couldn't be prouder of how we held our nerve in those final moments," said captain Rohit Sharma at the presentation ceremony.

The victory sparked nationwide celebrations, with fans pouring onto the streets in every major city. This marks India's third World Cup triumph, following their victories in 1983 and 2011.

Prime Minister Modi, who was present at the stadium, congratulated the team and announced a special reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan next week to honor the champions.
