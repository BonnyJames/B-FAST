**After Ever Happy (2022)????????????????** **Unni Krishnan TR** അന്ന ടോഡിൻ്റെ 'ആഫ്റ്റർ' എന്ന പേരിലുള്ള നോവലിനെ അടിസ്ഥാനമാക്കി കാസ്റ്റിൽ ലാൻഡൻ സംവിധാനം ചെയ്ത സിനിമാ പരമ്പരയിലെ അവസാന സിനിമയാണ് ഇത്. പ്രധാന വേഷത്തിൽ ജോസഫിൻ ലാങ്ഫോർഡ് ടെസ്സ യങ് യായും, ഫിയൻസ് ടിഫിൻ ഹാർഡിൻ സ്കോട്ടിനെയും അവതരിപ്പിക്കുന്നു. പ്രധാന കഥാപാത്രങ്ങൾ തമ്മിലുള്ള തന്നെ നിമിഷങ്ങളാണ് സിനിമയിലുടനീളം ഉള്ളത്. ഇതിനു മുൻപത്തെ സിനിമയായ After We Fell - ന്റെ അവസാനം സംഭവിച്ച ട്വിസ്റ്റിൽ നിന്നാണ് ഈ സിനിമയുടെ തുടങ്ങുന്നത്. കാണണോ വേണ്ടയോ എന്ന് ചോദിച്ചാൽ വെറുതെ കളയാൻ സമയമുണ്ടെങ്കിൽ ധൈര്യമായി കാണാം. ഈ പരമ്പരയിൽ ഇറങ്ങിയ മൂൻ മുൻ സിനിമകളിൽ പോലെതന്നെ നായികനായകന്മാർ തമിലുള്ള തല്ലിപിരിയൽ ഒന്നിച്ചുകൂടൽ മാത്രമാണുള്ളത്. സിനിമ കഴിയുമ്പോൾ വീണ്ടും എന്തിനോ തിളച്ച സാമ്പാർ പോലെ TO BE CONTINUED.. https://youtu.be/hLQ-5exgctI After Ever Happy is a 2022 American romantic drama film directed by Castille Landon, from a screenplay by Sharon Soboil. Based on the 2015 novel of the same name by Anna Todd, it is the fourth installment in the After film series, following After (2019), After We Collided (2020) and After We Fell (2021). The film stars Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin, reprising their roles as Tessa Young and Hardin Scott, respectively.[2] After Ever Happy had its world premiere in London on August 10, 2022, and was released theatrically on September 7, 2022.[3] A sequel, After Everything, is in production. A couple of hours after Christian Vance reveals to Hardin he is Hardin's biological father, Hardin returns to his mother's wedding reception with Tessa, where he confronts her about the deception. Vance tries to explain himself, but Hardin storms off with a bottle of whiskey. That evening, Tessa finds a drunk Hardin breaking into Trish's house and setting the place on fire. Hardin realizes his mistake and tries to put the fire out, to no avail, but Vance arrives and sneaks Hardin out the back to Tessa's car as the fire department arrives. Hardin wakes up the next morning and Tessa tells him Vance told the police he had set the fire himself. They drive to a hill where they have sex. Tessa and Hardin return to their hotel where she confides in Kimberley, Vance's fiancee, about her problems dealing with Hardin's anger issues before discovering Hardin has left the hotel. Tessa tracks him down to a party where she finds him drunk and high. She offers him a chance to leave with her, but he declines and she returns to the US. After her friend and Hardin's step brother, Landon, drops her off, she finds her father, Richard, dead in her apartment, having OD'd. Landon calls Hardin dozens of times to let him know before he finally picks up. He returns to Tessa and tries to comfort her, but she hides from him. Hardin argues with her mom, Carol, about whether he's good for Tessa's life and how he always abandons her. Still, Hardin, along with Landon, attends Richard's funeral to support Tessa. A couple days, Hardin and Tessa go to a dinner hosted by Hardin's dad, Ken, and Landon's mom, Karen, along with Landon and his friend, Nora, to say farewell to Landon as he moves to New York for school, where Nora also lives. After dinner, Tessa brings Hardin outside to talk. She tells him they need time apart to heal from their recent family developments and she's decided to leave Vance Publishing to move to New York with Landon. Hardin is hurt by the bombshell and nearly hits Landon out of rage for not telling him, but Landon reminds him he is also Tessa's friend as much as Hardin is his brother. Tessa gives Hardin an ultimatum that if he loves her, he'll not follow her to New York and let them have their time apart to which he reluctantly agrees to. Tessa moves in with Landon and starts working with Nora at a fancy restaurant and Hardin starts going to AA and graduates university. Months later, Hardin comes to New York for work and Landon offers to host him. Tessa takes double shifts to avoid Hardin, but he stays till she's off and they talk about how they've been; Hardin now being sober and Tessa waiting to get accepted into NYU. Over the next couple days, they spend some time together, slowly reconnecting, during which Landon starts a relationship with Nora, which the two congratulate him on. One night when Landon is at Nora's, Tessa and Hardin give in and have sex again. The next morning after Hardin leaves, Tessa finds a book in his bag, titled After, documenting their entire relationship. When Hardin returns, Tessa confronts him about the book, not wanting her life be published for everyone to see, but Hardin tells her there's already a bidding war for the book. He had read his journal during therapy and a publisher ended up reading it and everything has escalated since. Tessa leaves, declaring their relationship officially over. Some time later, Hardin's book has been named a Best-Times Seller. With not many friends at school and Landon having moved in with Nora, Tessa reaches out to Robert, Nora's friend who she had met awhile ago, for company. That night, Tessa eavesdrops in on a book signing hosted by Hardin where he tells the crowd his journey after meeting Tessa. Hardin catches a glimpse of Tessa as she leaves.
