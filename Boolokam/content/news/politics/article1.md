# New Economic Policy Announced

The government has announced a new economic policy aimed at boosting growth and creating jobs. The policy includes tax incentives for small businesses, increased infrastructure spending, and measures to attract foreign investment.

## Key Points of the Policy

1. **Tax Incentives for Small Businesses**: The policy includes a reduction in corporate tax rates for small and medium enterprises from 25% to 20%.

2. **Infrastructure Spending**: The government has allocated $50 billion for infrastructure development over the next five years, focusing on roads, railways, and renewable energy.

3. **Foreign Investment**: New regulations will make it easier for foreign companies to invest in key sectors such as technology, healthcare, and manufacturing.

## Expected Impact

Economists expect the policy to boost GDP growth by 1-2 percentage points in the coming year. The measures are also projected to create an estimated 500,000 new jobs.

> "This policy represents a significant shift in our economic approach. We are focusing on sustainable growth that benefits all segments of society," said the Finance Minister during the announcement.

Business leaders have generally welcomed the announcement, though some opposition politicians have criticized certain aspects of the policy, arguing that it favors large corporations over small businesses.

The policy will be implemented in phases starting next month, with all measures expected to be in place by the end of the year.
