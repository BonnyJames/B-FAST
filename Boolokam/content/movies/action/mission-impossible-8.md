## Plot

The film takes viewers across the globe, from the crowded streets of Tokyo to the snow-capped mountains of Norway, as Hunt races against time to prevent a catastrophic attack that threatens not just millions of lives but the very future of global security.

## Production

Following the tradition of pushing boundaries, Tom Cruise performed what is being described as the most dangerous stunt of his career for this film. The sequence, filmed in Norway, involved Cruise riding a motorcycle off a cliff and transitioning into a BASE jump.

> "This is without question the most dangerous thing we've ever attempted," said director Christopher McQuarrie. "We spent over a year preparing for that sequence alone."

The film was shot during challenging conditions amid global restrictions, with production spanning locations in Norway, Italy, the UK, and Japan.
